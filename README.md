# Tabletop Game Map: The Straits of Gibraltar for Leviathans

Comission for Rawbert.

The game is played on a hexagonal grid, like Battletech, so I drew on some of my work on Juno Beach maps and Joel Uckelman's mkhexgrid (https://www.nomic.net/~uckelman/mkhexgrid/) to create a map that reflected the elevation of nearby mountains while being much simpler than my intention for the Op Juno maps.

## Programs used:
- QGIS Desktop (FOSS, https://qgis.org/)
- GIMP (FOSS, https://www.gimp.org/)
- Inkscape (FOSS, https://inkscape.org/)

## Datasets for topographical representation:

These are all the datasets I documented, I'm now not entirely sure which specific one made it into the final map.

## Challenges and lessons learned

This was probably the first self-chosen project where I stopped pursuing perfection and settled for "good enough" which was an enormous challenge. I'm beginning to accept the fact that I have perfectionistic tendencies which prevent me from moving ahead with projects I want to do and hinder my progress towards my goals. In that spirit, the map is not what I would be happy to call "excellent" but rather "good enough for now".

I'm still troubled by the fact that it feels pale and washed out and that the hex grid overlay made it virtually impossible to incorporate any kind of contour line data -- I tried and it was much too overwhelming, visually even with pale contour lines. I would have to experiment with a much smaller map to find a combination of elements that helps convey hex grid, topographical colouration and contour lines without overwhelmind the viewer.

There were also aspirations to incorporate 1900s era graphical map elements like shading and hashing, but that also proved unvable given the amount of visual data already present and the hexagonal overlay. Sadface. I really wanted to incorporate some elements that would make the map "feel" like it was from the 1900s to go with the steampunk aesthetic of Leviathans.

I learned a fair bit about QGIS yet I'm still not completely comfortable with the tool, I always feel like it could do a lot more than what I'm able to do with it only because of the way I'm approaching the project -- as a piece of visual, communicative art rather than a GIS project. Nevertheless, the limitations of the final result, inaccuracies are all mine, QGIS is a fantastic tool I'd like to keep learning how to use for future projects.

Map colours for elevation were from a printed atlas I have at home, sampled in Inkscape from a photo I took.
